# Integers are numbers without decimals. Adding a decimal will make it a floating point number

int = 1
float = 1.0

# Words are strings and are declared with " " or ' '. Better to use " " so ' can be used in string

string = "Hello"
sentence = "Don't worry about apostrophes"

# This can be done with more than one variable at a time

number, another_number = 2, 3

# Operators work with them (e.g. +). Note the manual addition of a space

word1 = "Hi"
word2 = "Ben"
greeting = word1 + " " + word2

print(greeting)

# Numbers and strings cannot be operated together. The following would fail.

# failure = word1 + " " + number	Commented out so it doesn't make this whole shell fail.
